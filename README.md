# Wk2-MyPortfolio
A web application created from scratch that serves as a portfolio page.

## Description
This repository is my first ever web application that I've created from scratch and will serve as a portfolio page to highlight my work.

This project was completed after learning advanced CSS and designed specifically to challenge us to use CSS variables, flexbox, and media queries for responsive design.

The following acceptance criteria were used in the development of this web application:

* When portfolio loads, includes my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and contact information
* Links in the navigation jumps to the corresponding section in the page
* The work section contains titled images of the developer's applications
* The first image in the work section is larger in size than the other work images
* Images of the applications in my work section deploy to the application upon clicking
* Web application has a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport upon resizing or viewing on various screens and devices

## Notes on Development
* I would like to still improve on implementing flexbox and responsive design
* Looking back, I'd probably start with a simpler idea, but I was eager to try out some layouts and incorporate a picture aesthic. Eventually, I'll likely adjust the About Me section so it's more professional-focused.
* I was struggling with the title for the first portfolio item in the WORK section to adhere to absolute positioning and ended up having to get creative with relative position. Not ideal and would want more time to delve into why it wasn't behaving as expected with absolute position within the portfolio item's image.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
